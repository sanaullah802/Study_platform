   - **Max file size:** `10000000` (10MB)
4. Click **"Save"**

## Step 4: Update Your .env File

```env
# Replace these with your actual Cloudinary credentials
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dxyz123abc
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Cloud Name not configured"
- Check your `.env` file has the correct `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- Restart the development server

### ‚ùå "Upload Preset not configured"
- Make sure you created the upload preset in Cloudinary dashboard
- Check the preset name is exactly `studypoint_uploads`
- Ensure it's set to "Unsigned" mode

### ‚ùå "Upload failed: Invalid upload preset"
- The upload preset doesn't exist or is not unsigned
- Go back to Cloudinary dashboard and check the preset settings

### ‚ùå "Upload failed: Invalid cloud name"
- Double-check your cloud name in the `.env` file
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes

## Security Notes

- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` - never commit it to version control
- For production deployment, set these as environment variables in your hosting platform
- The API secret is not used in client-side uploads (only cloud name and upload preset)

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

1. Set environment variables in your hosting platform:
   - `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
   - `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`
2. You don't need to set API_KEY and API_SECRET for client-side uploads

## File Size and Format Limits

Current limits set in upload preset:
- **Max file size:** 10MB
- **Allowed formats:** jpg, png, gif, pdf, doc, docx, txt, ppt, pptx

To change these:
1. Go to Cloudinary dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Upload
2. Edit your `studypoint_uploads` preset
3. Modify the limits as needed
